# Student Management System (Console-Based)

This is a simple **Java console application** that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) using a **menu-driven system**. The application allows users to **Add**, **View**, **Update**, and **Delete** student records using a basic `ArrayList`.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Add a student with ID, name, and marks  
- 📋 View all student details  
- 🔁 Update student data by ID  
- ❌ Delete a student record by ID  
- 🚪 Exit the application  

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Java classes and objects
- Constructor usage
- ArrayList operations
- Scanner for user input
- Method overriding (`toString()`)
- Looping and conditional statements
- Simple CRUD operations.
